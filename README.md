# WebCamSharp-OpenCVSharp3

Why?
The goal of this project was to learn how to make public nuget packages and provide easy way for beginning coders.

How?
I used OpenCVSharp, based on another package, with my own twist. See example projects on how to use it.

What next? 
I plan on making the same for newest OpenCVSharp4.
